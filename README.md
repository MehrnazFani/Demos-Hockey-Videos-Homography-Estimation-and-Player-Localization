# Demos for ice-rink/player localization from broadcast hockey videos
In this repository two video demos are provided. The first demo is based on a [WiCV(@ CVPR) paper](
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2104.10847) that estimates the homography of the hockey ice-rink between 
each frame of the broadcast hockey video and the top-view NHL template of the ice-rink.
